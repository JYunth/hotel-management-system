A clean and minimalist Hotel Management System (HMS) is program that keeps track of hotel room availability and 
occupant's information.

All information you input to HMS is stored into a SQLite database file (.db), that is how you will keep entire 
overview of the complete hotel occupation 24/7. Program is currently available in the English language.

What kind of data can we collect with HMS?
Occupants name, address, mobile number, number of days they will occupy room for.

Hotel management system will keep track check-ins and check-outs from your hotel, which gives you an overview of all your occupants, what is the room they occupy and their details and all that is just one click away. The program is light, fast and resourceful. The perfect companion for the urban hotel owner.
